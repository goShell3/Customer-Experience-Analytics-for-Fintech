# Banking App Reviews Analysis - Progress Report

## Project Overview
This project analyzes user reviews of Ethiopian banking applications to extract insights and trends. The analysis focuses on three major banks:
- Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE)
- Bank of Abyssinia (BOA)
- Dashen Bank

## Current Progress

### 1. Project Setup âœ…
- Created project structure with necessary directories
- Set up version control with Git
- Added essential configuration files:
  - requirements.txt with dependencies
  - .gitignore for Python project
  - README.md with setup instructions

### 2. Data Collection âœ…
- Implemented review scraping script (`src/data/scrape_reviews.py`)
- Features:
  - Scrapes 400+ reviews for each banking app
  - Collects review text, ratings, and dates
  - Handles pagination and error cases
  - Saves raw data as CSV
- Data sources:
  - Google Play Store
  - Reviews in English
  - Focus on Ethiopian market

### 3. Data Preprocessing âœ…
- Implemented cleaning script (`src/data/clean_reviews.py`)
- Features:
  - Removes duplicate reviews
  - Handles missing data
  - Normalizes dates to YYYY-MM-DD format
  - Adds source tracking
  - Includes detailed logging
- Output:
  - Cleaned data saved as CSV
  - Maintains data quality and consistency

### 4. Testing âœ…
- Added test file for preprocessing functions
- Tests cover:
  - Text cleaning
  - Date normalization
  - Duplicate removal
  - Missing data handling
